# book-search-engine
This project was to refactor the existing code to convert the site from a restful api to a react-app.  splitting the root into a client side and server side and creating my
resolvers and typedefs to be implemented into the existing code.  The functionality of the site is a user and signup and login, then search for books and save them to their
profile.
